      <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website!</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Uyen Tran, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself
        with you. I'm currently a student at the University of California,
        Irvine, where I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My passion for
        technology and problem-solving has driven me to explore various aspects
        of computer science, from programming to software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a keen interest in web
        development and design. I enjoy creating user-friendly and visually
        appealing websites that provide a seamless experience for users. This
        personal website is a reflection of my skills and interests, and I hope
        it gives you a glimpse into who I am.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not studying or working on projects, I love spending time
        cooking though I'm not really good at it. I also love exploring new
        places, and trying out different cuisines. I believe that a well-rounded
        life is essential for personal growth and happiness.
      </p>
