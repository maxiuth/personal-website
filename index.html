          Hello! My name is Uyen Tran, and I'm excited to share a bit about
          myself with you. I'm currently a student at CSUF, where I'm pursuing a
          degree in Computer Science. My passion for technology and
          problem-solving has driven me to explore various aspects of computer
          science, from programming to software development.
        </p>
        <p class="oldenburg-regular">
          When I'm not studying or working on projects, I love spending time
          cooking though I'm not really good at it. I also love exploring new
          places, and trying out different cuisines. I believe that a
          well-rounded life is essential for personal growth and happiness.
        </p>
        <p class="oldenburg-regular">
          Thank you for visiting my personal website! Feel free to explore the
          different sections to learn more about me, my portfolio, and how to
          get in touch. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations,
          so don't hesitate to reach out!
